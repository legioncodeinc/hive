/**
 * The dashboard CLIENT-SIDE ROUTER — PRD-003c (m-AC-1 / m-AC-2, retiring the hash router).
 *
 * thehive's SERVER is now the routing authority (PRD-003a): it evaluates the health-then-auth
 * gate on every request and serves the identical SPA shell for every real, path-based route
 * (`the-hive/src/daemon/dashboard/host.ts`'s catch-all). This hook's job narrows to what a
 * server-routed SPA needs client-side: read the ALREADY-AUTHORIZED path the server served
 * (`location.pathname`), keep it in sync with History API navigation (back/forward, and this
 * hook's own `navigate`), and re-render. It does NOT decide what the operator is ALLOWED to see —
 * that decision was already made server-side before this bundle ever ran.
 *
 * This RETIRES `useHashRoute` / `routeFromHash` (m-AC-1): routing no longer reads `location.hash`,
 * and `navigate` calls `history.pushState` instead of assigning `location.hash`, so history entries
 * are real paths, not fragments (m-AC-2). Still NO `react-router`, NO new dependency — the History
 * API is a browser primitive, mirroring the hash hook's own no-new-dependency posture.

/**
 * Parse the current route string from `location.pathname`. Normalizes an empty path to the
 * default `/`. The returned value is the RAW route key (e.g. `/graph`); resolving it to a
 * registry entry (and the unknown→Dashboard fallback) is `matchRoute`'s job (`registry.tsx`), not
 * this parser's — this keeps the hook a pure reflection of the URL, mirroring `routeFromHash`'s
 * old contract one-for-one, just sourced from the path instead of the fragment.

 * `navigate` updates the local route state directly too; this keeps exactly one source of truth
 * (the URL) and one mutator (`navigate`), mirroring the retired hash hook's contract. Deep-linking
